			<h2>ESG:</h2>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance">ESG</a> stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. Investors are increasingly applying these non-financial factors as part of their analysis process to identify material risks and growth opportunities. This guide takes fiduciary duty, externalities, disclosures, and other important ESG issues into account.</p>
			<h3>Priorities for actions</h3>

				<li><a href="#addressing">Addressing gender roles.</a></li>
				<li><a href="#promoting">Promoting women in decision-making.</a></li>
				<li><a href="#supporting">Supporting work-life balance.</a></li>
				<li><a href="#paying">Tackling the gender pay gap.</a></li>
			</ol>
			<p>These priorities are interconnected and of equal importance.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container" id="addressing">
			<h2>1. Addressing gender roles</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Although the role of the social partners is not to interfere with private life, <mark>social partners do have a role to play in addressing gender roles and stereotypes in employment and in the workplace.</mark></li>
				<li>In the past three decades, <mark>women’s employment rates have increased significantly and faster than men's, but not equally in all sectors and occupations.</mark> Women tend to be overrepresented in specific areas of activity related to traditional gender roles.</li>
				<li>Breaking down cultural barriers to ensure that <mark>women and men follow a more diverse range of careers.</mark></li>
				<li>Check their internal practices and policies in order to <mark>actively encourage particular groups of people to enter and remain in employment.</mark></li>
				<li>
					European social partners believe that the following elements are key to fight stereotyped gender roles on the labour market.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<mark>Promoting non-gender biased education in schools, universities as well as efficient and non-stereotyped careers advice services</mark>, for students and those already at work, to enable individuals to make better informed education and career choices. Example:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Organising open days in companies for girls in order to show that pre-conceived ideas about women’s compared with men’s jobs are not justified</mark> in practice and inform them about career options they may not have considered otherwise</li>
								<li><mark>Cooperation programmes with public and/or education authorities to raise awareness on labour markets needs</mark> like <a href="https://molengeek.com/">molengeek</a>.
								</li>
								<li>Participation in career fairs.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><mark>Making a special effort to attract girls and young women into technical and scientific professions.</mark> Example:
							<ul>
								<li>Setting targets to <mark>increase the number of girls taking up apprenticeships in technical and scientific professions</mark> as a way to step up female recruitment in the future.</li>
								<li><mark>Sending women engaged in technical or scientific occupations as “ambassadors” into schools</mark> to inform and raise awareness of girls
								about opportunities of technical or scientific professions.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><mark>Promoting the recruitment and retention of women</mark> and men with adequate skills at the enterprise level in sectors and occupations <mark>where they are underrepresented.</mark> Example: 
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Reviewing the way in which job titles, job descriptions and advertisements are formulated to enhance their attractiveness for women</mark></li>
								<li>Adapting the workplace to enable a greater gender mix at work <mark>(ergonomics, local services)</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Informing about internal job offers and career prospects on intranet.</mark></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Raising awareness of middle managers in companies on ways to promote equal opportunities for all employees. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Highlight top managers’ commitment to a diverse workforce</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Training managers on the benefits of diversity management</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Ensuring good information flow</mark> between the designated contact persons for staff grievances on equal opportunities issues, and managers, who have the responsibility to take action</li>
								<li>Highlighting cases of women breaking new ground</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Promoting entrepreneurship as a career option for both women and men at sector and/or national level. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Identifying potential female business starters and/or top managers, and train them.</mark></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Encouraging competence development for adults to allow men and women to evolve in their careers throughout life and to address deficits created by the structure of the education system in the past, with particular attention to supporting SMEs in their efforts. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Ensuring transparency and transferability of competences and qualifications.</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Promoting the participation of low-skilled workers and/or workers in non-standard employment in further education and training</mark> and lifelong learning.</li>
								<li><mark>Setting gender balance objectives at sectoral level for access to vocational training.</mark></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="container" id="promoting">
			<h2>2. Promoting women in decision-making</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Only 30% of managers are women, only 10 % of members of boards of directors are women, and only 3 % of CEO’s or
					equivalent positions are taken by women. Action -> <mark>ensure that the overall working environment supports a more balanced participation of women and men in decision-making.</mark>
				</li>
				<li>
					Companies who have successfully encouraged women’s participation at managerial level report that they did so as part of their efforts to achieve a high performance
					workplace by taking initiatives to release women’s untapped potential. <mark>Promoting women in decision-making positions is an investment for a more productive, innovative and stimulating working environment and better economic performance.</mark>
				</li>
				<li>
					Potential key elements:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Promoting competence-based gender neutral recruitment in enterprises. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Putting in place transparent and gender neutral recruitment, selection and promotion criteria</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Checking that the recruitment of women is proportionate to the number of female applications</mark> for the job and review results on a regular basis.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Retaining women in enterprises, to avoid loss of competence. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Discussing at an early stage with employees their career expectations as well as work-life balance</mark> needs of both women and men and how to combine them with company’s needs</li>
								<li><mark>Conducting interviews with women leaving a company </mark>to understand the reasons for doing so.</li>
								<li><mark>Conducting regular staff surveys to check employees satisfaction.</mark></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Encouraging career development of both women and men. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Developing networks, mentoring or self confidence buildin schemes across enterprises</mark> to address the issue of selfdeselection</li>
								<li><mark>Setting targets for the promotion of women in proportion to the number of women in the relevant occupational level</mark> and review results on a regular basis</li>
								<li><mark>Identifying possibilities for non linear career development paths alternating periods of higher professional involvement and periods of greater family responsibility</mark> as an alternative to a culture of <mark>unnecessarily long working hours</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Facilitating geographical mobility</mark> of managers by helping the worker’s partner to find a job in the new region of occupation.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<mark>Promoting female entrepreneurship</mark> as a complementary way of increasing women in decision-making and raising women’s participation in the labour market. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Putting in place regional programmes for women willing to start their own business;</mark></li>
								<li>Supporting projects to ease generational handover to women in SMEs.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<mark>Promoting women’s role in the social dialogue at all levels, both on the employers’ side and the trade union side.</mark> Special attention should be paid to the possibility for women to take up responsibilities in worker representation.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="container" id="promoting">
			<h2>3. Supporting work-life balance</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Work life balance arrangements can enhance employee satisfaction, promote workplace equality, contribute to an organisation’s reputation as an employer of choice, and benefit employers as well as workers. <mark>Successful policies to support work-life balance need to be tailored to the needs of individual women and men, bearing in mind that these can vary</mark> throughout the life course and taking into account that long and/or irregular working hours can be an obstacle to reconcile work and family life for both men and women.</li>
				<li><mark>Ensuring the availability and affordability of quality care facilities, for children, elderly and/or other dependents,</mark> to allow men and women to join the labour market. Where appropriate, partnerships between public authorities and social partners can help in devising innovative solutions.</li>
				<li>
					Key Elements:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<mark>Considering flexible working arrangements that can be taken up on a voluntary basis by both women and men,</mark> including leave arrangements, designed in a way that does not undermine their long term participation and position on the labour market. Examples:
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Flexibility in working time or the organisation of work, such as part-time work, job-sharing, reduced hours, compressed working week, school term-time working, staggered or gliding hours, timeoff and ad hoc home working etc.</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Career breaks and parental leave arrangements.</mark></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Promoting a more balanced take-up of possibilities to ease work-life balance. Examples:
					<ul>
						<li><mark>Company internal awareness raising schemes to promote take-up of flexible work options,</mark> especially by men, including in male dominated professions</li>
						<li><mark>Information campaigns about leave possibilities available to both women and men</mark> and <mark>encouraging parents to share leave periods more equally.</mark></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Jointly approaching public authorities to develop instruments that help increase the availability of accessible and <mark>affordable child care facilities and seeking innovative ways of providing essential private household or caring services.</mark> Examples:
					<ul>
						<li><mark>Attracting on site services such as travel office, shops, bank and insurance offices etc;</mark></li>
						<li><mark>Sponsoring child care centers or providing an allowance</mark> covering part of the nursery costs to parents;</li>
						<li><mark>Creating funds by collective agreements or other means to “mutualise” the costs of maternity or parental leave allowances helps to ensure that women no longer represent a more costly source of labour than men.</mark> <mark>Similar measures</mark> can be useful to support childcare projects addressing specific needs of working parents such as care <mark>for sick children, care outside regular opening hours, etc.</mark> This can help in particular SMEs.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="container" id="paying">
			<h2>4. Tackling the gender pay gap.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the EU there is a strong legal framework, based on article 141 of the EUTreaty, providing women and men with the right to equal pay for equal work and work  of equal value.</li>
				<li>Possible action could be: equal pay reviews, equality plans, benchmarking, etc. Practice also shows that using modernisation of pay systems as an opportunity for gender mainstreaming can be extremely effective.</li>
				<li>
					Keys to tackle the gender pay gap.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<mark>Informing about existing legislation on equal pay and giving guidance on how to help closing the gender pay gap at different levels.</mark> Examples of practical tools used to do so include:
							<ul>
								<li>Practical guide, especially for SMEs, on how to live up to their legal obligations;</li>
								<li>National or sectoral collective agreements or framework agreements.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Developing clear up to date statistics and promoting the availability of gender specific information at the appropriate levels (national, sectoral and/or company level). Examples:
							<ul>
								<li>Develop a joint method, taking into account as wide a range of variables as possible, in order to <mark>have a detailed and analytical picture of the underlying causes of wage differences between women and men.</mark></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<mark>Ensuring that pay systems, including job evaluation schemes, are transparent and gender neutral</mark> and paying attention to the possible discriminatory effects of secondary elements of pay. Examples
							<ul>
								<li><mark>Screening job descriptions to check that they don’t contain discriminatory elements;</mark></li>
								<li><mark>Reviewing pay criteria to check that they are not discriminatory;</mark></li>
								<li>Developing tool kits comprising different elements in order to give background information to negotiators dealing with gender equality issues and to offer practical advice on what employers and workers can do in enterprises;</li>
								<li><mark>Use existing on-line tools providing information on wage formation</mark> and enabling individuals to compare their salaries with that of other employees.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
